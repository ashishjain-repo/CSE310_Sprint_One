`git checkout -b branch-name` it is a good practice to work on a branch instead of the main or master branch, so it does not disrupt the flow. Working on a branch can help you organize your code and you will be able to check it locally before pushing it all to the main or master branch where the important code resides.

## Git Branch
`git branch` this command will open a list of available branches that are created by you and the main branch. You can see what branch you are working on in the list where the name of the branch have a astrisk before it, this could look something like this:-
```
main
my-branch
* inbox-function
