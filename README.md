# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Relational Database

We are using MySQL Server for our RDBMS

We have created three tables in our database which are: `User`, `Item`, and `Category`. So one user can have more than one items and that items is belong to one of the categories.

# Development Environment
We primarily used Git version control, MySQL Server, MySQL Workbench, and Visual Studio Code.

The primary programming language that has been used in the project is Python and SQL. We also added additional packages like `python-dotenv`, `mysql-connector-python`, `tabulate`, `pwinput`.

# Future Work
